<h2 style='margin-bottom:2px;'> Number of graphs up to isomorphism </h2>
<p style='margin-top:1px;'> 2023-05-05 </p>
<hr>
<p><strong>This blog post is a re-write up of an interesting problem I
encountered during my time taking CMSC 27410 (Honors Combinatorics) at
UChicago.</strong></p>
<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>
<p>Here we note the problem it its entirety.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Problem.</strong> Denote <span
class="math inline">\(g_n\)</span> the number of graphs, up to
isomorphism, with <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> vertices. Show
that <span class="math display">\[\log_2 g_n \sim n^2/2.\]</span> as
<span class="math inline">\(n\to\infty\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="preliminaries">Preliminaries</h2>
<p>There are a couple premlinary results and notations that we note here
that we will be using without proof. They are all very well known
results and so this should not be problem. We will be assuming some
familiarity with abstract algebra (esp. group theory) and some basic
probability. - Two graphs <span class="math inline">\(G_1, G_2\)</span>
are considered isomorphic if there exists a bijection of vertices <span
class="math inline">\(f: V\to V\)</span>, such that <span
class="math display">\[v\sim u \quad \text{implies} \quad f(v) \sim
f(u)\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\sim\)</span> denotes
that two vertices are neighbors. - We denote the symmetric group of
order <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> as <span
class="math inline">\(S_n\)</span>. We can consider this the group of
permutations of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> elements. In
particular <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\in S_n\)</span> has a
obvious action on <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> via
permutation. - The <em>orbit</em> of an element <span
class="math inline">\(x\in X\)</span> are the elements of <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span> which can be reached by <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> via action from <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span>, i.e. <span
class="math display">\[\{g\cdot x: g\in G\}.\]</span></p>
<p>Finally, we note the following famous lemma.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Lemma. (Burnside)</strong> Suppose <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is a finite group acting on <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. For each <span
class="math inline">\(g\in G\)</span>, we can denote <span
class="math inline">\(\operatorname{fix}_ X(g)\)</span> the set of
elements in <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> that are fixed under
the action of <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> (i.e. <span
class="math inline">\(g\cdot x = x\)</span>). Then <span
class="math display">\[\left| X/G\right| = \frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{g\in
G}|\operatorname{fix}_X(g)|.\]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It will become evident why this result will be useful later on.</p>
<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>
<p>First, we can glean a couple insights. Consider <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{Graph}(n)\)</span>, the set of all graphs
with <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> vertices, i.e. <span
class="math display">\[\mathrm{Graph}(n)=\{(V,E): |V|=n\}.\]</span> We
first consider the number of graphs that are isomorphic to some graph,
say <span class="math inline">\(G\in \mathrm{Graph}(n)\)</span>. If we
label all the vertices of <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> from
<span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> through <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, we can note that any isomorphism of
graphs <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> will simply be a
permutation of the labels of vertices of <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span> by definition (recall that a
permutation can be considered a bijection from a finite set to itself).
Thus we know that the number of isomorphism classes in <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{Graph}(n)\)</span> is in fact the number
of orbits in <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{Graph}(n)\)</span>
under the action of <span class="math inline">\(S_n\)</span>, since any
two graphs in the same orbit are reachably by a composition of
permutations (isomorphisms).</p>
<p>From here, we can apply Burnside’s Lemma to obtain <span
class="math display">\[g_n = \frac{1}{|S_n|}\sum_{\sigma\in S_n}
|\mathrm{fix}_ {\mathrm{Graph}(n)}(\sigma)|. \]</span> We can observe
that <span class="math inline">\(\operatorname{fix}_
{\mathrm{Graph}(n)}(\sigma)\)</span> is the set of graphs <span
class="math inline">\(G\in \mathrm{Graph}(n)\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(\sigma\in \operatorname{Aut}(G)\)</span>. From
here, we can “pull out” the identity permutation <span
class="math inline">\(e\in S_n\)</span> from the summation: <span
class="math display">\[\frac{1}{|S_n|}\sum_{\sigma\in S_n}
|\mathrm{fix}_ {\mathrm{Graph} (n)}(\sigma)| = \frac{1}{|S_n|}\left(
|\mathrm{fix}_ {\mathrm{Graph(n)}} (e)| + \sum_{\substack{\sigma\in S_n
\\ \sigma\neq e}} |\mathrm{fix}_ {\mathrm{Graph}(n)}(\sigma)|
\right).\]</span> Let us try to fill in some concrete values. It is well
know that <span class="math inline">\(|S_n|=n!\)</span>. Since the
identity is always in the automorphism group (trivially), we can note
that <span class="math display">\[|\mathrm{fix}_ {\mathrm{Graph(n)}}
(e)| = |\mathrm{Graph}(n)| = 2^{\binom{n}{2}}.\]</span></p>
<p>where the last equality (again, well-known) comes from the fact that
for any pair of vertices, we have the choice of creating an edge between
those vertices or not to create any valid graph. Therefore, we reach
<span class="math display">\[g_n = \frac{1}{n!}{2^{\binom n2}} +
\frac{1}{n!}\sum_{\substack{\sigma\in S_n \\ \sigma\neq e}}
|\mathrm{fix}_{\mathrm{Graph}(n)}(\sigma)|. \tag{$\star$}\]</span> So
far the mathematics we had use has been rather routine; but worry not as
we have just now reached the crux of this problem. It is to determine
the (asymptotic) value of the summation in <span
class="math inline">\((\star)\)</span>.</p>
<p>We can note that in essence, we are finding the average number of
non-trivial automorphisms in <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{Graph}(n)\)</span> as <span
class="math inline">\(n\to\infty\)</span>.</p>
<h3 id="non-trivial-isomorphisms-of-mathrmgraphn">Non-Trivial
Isomorphisms of <span
class="math inline">\(\mathrm{Graph}(n)\)</span></h3>
<p>From here, we will roughly sketch the proof as a thourough proof is
too complex for a blog post. For specific information, one can check out
the original treatment in <a
href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01895716">[Erdos &amp;
Renyi, 1963]</a>. We can build up the result we want by first
considering the following. A <em>random graph with <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> vertices</em> is a graph with <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> vertices constructed such that each
edge between any two vertices has a probability <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> of forming. For our purposes, we will
consider <span class="math inline">\(p=1/2\)</span>. Then we consider
the quantity <span class="math inline">\(P(\sigma)\)</span>, which is
the probability on a random graph that <span
class="math inline">\(\sigma\in S_n\)</span> is a automorphism. We first
consider a result for <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-cycles.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Lemma 1.</strong> If <span
class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> is a <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-cycle, then <span
class="math display">\[P(\sigma) = 2^{-(n-2)k}.\]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Proof (sketch)</em>. Suppose <span
class="math inline">\(k=2\)</span>. Pick any two vertices <span
class="math inline">\(u,v\)</span> of the random graph <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span>. Then if <span
class="math inline">\(u\sim a\)</span> then it must be that <span
class="math inline">\(v\sim a\)</span> in order for <span
class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> to be an automorphism, where <span
class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> is the transposition <span
class="math inline">\((uv)\)</span>. There are <span
class="math inline">\(2^{k-2}\)</span> possible edge arrangements for
<span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> (excluding edges to <span
class="math inline">\(v\)</span>), so in this case <span
class="math display">\[P(\sigma) = 2^{k-2}\cdot2^{-k+2}\cdot 2^{-k+2} =
2^{-k+2}.\]</span> We can repeat this logic for <span
class="math inline">\(3\)</span>-cycles to get <span
class="math inline">\(2^{-2k+4}\)</span>, and so on for <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-cycles. <strong>∎</strong></p>

<tr>
<td>It is easy to observe that summing over all <span
class="math inline">\(P(\sigma)\)</span>, the terms accounting for the
transpositions dominates as <span
class="math inline">\(n\to\infty\)</span>. Therefore, we can
conclude</td>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Lemma 2.</strong> Suppose <span class="math inline">\(G\in
\mathrm{Graph}(n)\)</span> has non-trivial automorphisms. Then <span
class="math display">\[|S_n\cap \mathrm{Aut}(G)| = 1\qquad \text{a.s. as
} n\to\infty\]</span> Namely, the one nontrivial automorphism is a
transposition.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Proof (sketch).</em> Since the <span
class="math inline">\(P(\sigma)\)</span> terms from the tranpositions
dominate, we can conclude from conditional probability and Lemma 1.
∎</p>
<p>Let us denote <span class="math inline">\(h_n =
|\mathrm{Graph}(n)|\)</span>. From Lemma 2, we know that any graph which
does have a nontrivial automorphism, it is almost surely a transposition
(for big <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>). So we can count this
by the following procedure. First, generate a random graph with <span
class="math inline">\(n-1\)</span> vertices. Take some vertex <span
class="math inline">\(v\)</span>. Then we can create such a graph by
adding a new vertex <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> such that it
has the same neighbors as <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>, then
choosing to create an edge between <span
class="math inline">\(u,v\)</span> or not. Thus asympotically there are
<span class="math inline">\(\sim 2n h_{n-1}\)</span> such graphs. Thus
in the limit, the density of graphs with non-trivial automorphisms
(denoted <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>) is <span
class="math display">\[d= \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{2nh_{n-1}}{h_n} =
\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{2n\cdot 2^{\binom{n-1}{2}}}{2^{\binom n 2}} \to
0\]</span> i.e. for big <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, any
random graph will have only a trivial automorphism group with very high
probability. Thus if we pass <span
class="math inline">\((\star)\)</span> through the limit, we can know
that <span class="math inline">\(|\mathrm{fix}_{\mathrm{Graph}(n)}| =
0\)</span> with very high probability. Therefore in the limit, we can
write <span class="math display">\[g_n\sim \frac{1}{n!} 2^{\binom n
2}\]</span> and we can see that <span
class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
2^{\binom n 2}/n! = \frac{2^{\frac{n!}{2!(n-2)!}}}{n!} =
\frac{2^{\frac{n(n-1)}{2}}}{n!}
\end{align*}\]</span> Therefore by log rules, <span
class="math display">\[
\log_2 g_n = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} - \log_2 n!\]</span> where since <span
class="math inline">\(\log_2n!\)</span> grows subquadratically<a
href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>, we can conclude that <span
class="math display">\[\log_2 g_n \sim n^2/2.\]</span> as desired.</p>
<h2 id="afterword">Afterword</h2>
<p>The reason I chose this problem was because I thought the
intersection of probability and algebra in a combinatorics problem was
quite interesting. While any well trained modern combinatorist will
easily point out that these subjects have been indispensible tools in
the field for a long time, I was personally quite shocked at the mosaic
of techniques required here when I first solved this question. Thus I
thought it appropriate to give it a rough treatment here.</p>
