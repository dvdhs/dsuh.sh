<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>In a normal treatment of probability theory, one of the first
properties of taking expectation <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb
E\)</span> is <em>linearity</em>: <span class="math display">\[
\mathbb E[X + Y] = \mathbb E[X] + \mathbb E[Y].
\]</span></p>
<p>Though it is a pretty unassuming property for most students, it is
actually a very useful and interesting property. A common use case is
for problems where the different RV’s are “obviously” independent. &gt;
<em>Example 1: Sum of two dice</em> &gt; &gt; Suppose we have two dice.
We can denote their pip values as <span
class="math inline">\(X_1,X_2\)</span> and then note &gt; <span
class="math display">\[\mathbb E[X_1+X_2] = \mathbb E[X_1] + \mathbb
E[X_2] = 2\cdot 3.5 = 7. \]</span></p>
<p>But are there any more striking examples of using linearity of
expectation? Yes – a classical problem(s) known as <em>Buffon’s {Needle
| Noodle}</em>, with the latter being a short generalization of the
former. We will first solve the Needle problem using usual probability
theory, before providing a generalized result using expectation.</p>
<h3 id="buffons-needle">Buffon’s Needle</h3>
<p>The problem statement is as follows: if we have a plane consisting of
evenly spaced parallel lines (in one axis), if we have a randomly place
line segment of length <span class="math inline">\(\ell\)</span> on the
plane, what the probability that the segment intersects one of the
lines? A more real-to-life statement often involves a wooden plank floor
and the probability a needle (hence the name) intersects the border of
two planes. To solve this problem, we first setup a couple of variables.
We can denote <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> as the distance
from the center of the line segment to the nearest vertical line segment
(where we use the usual notion of point-line distance). Then we can
denote <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> as the acute angle
formed between the line segment and the vertical line axis.</p>

<p><em>Diagram of setup variables</em></p>
<p>Since the distance <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> can vary
from <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(d\)</span>, where <span
class="math inline">\(d\)</span> denotes the intervals between vertical
lines, and clearly the distribution is uniform, we can conclude <span
class="math display">\[
f_x(t) = \frac{1}{d/2} = 2/d, \qquad t\in[0, d/2]
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(f_x\)</span> denotes the PDF
of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. In a similar fashion, we can
write <span class="math display">\[
f_{\theta}(t) = 2/\pi, \qquad t\in[0, \pi/2].
\]</span> We can note that then the needle crosses a vertical line if
<span class="math display">\[
x \leq \frac\ell 2 \sin(\theta).
\]</span> From here, we take two cases.</p>
<p><strong>[Short Needle]</strong>. Suppose <span
class="math inline">\(\ell \leq d\)</span>. Thus with probability 1, the
needle will only cross a single vertical line, if any. Then we can write
the probability of crossing <span class="math display">\[
\begin{align*}
P &amp;= \int_{[0,d/2]\times [0,\pi/2]}f_{x,\theta}(x,\theta) \bm 1_{\\{
x \leq \frac\ell 2 \sin(\theta)\\}} \diff (x,\theta)\\\ &amp;=\int_{\theta=0}^{\pi/2}\int_{x=0}^{(\ell/2)\sin(\theta)} f_x(x)
f_\theta(\theta) \diff x \diff \theta \\\ &amp;=\int_{\theta=0}^{\pi/2}\int_{x=0}^{(\ell/2)\sin(\theta)}
\frac{4}{d\pi} \diff x \diff \theta \\\ &amp;= \frac{2l}{d\pi}.
\end{align*}
\]</span></p>
<p><strong>[Long Needle]</strong>. In this case, we must take into
consideration the cases where the needle is long enough to gurantee
crossing a vertical line. In particular, if the horizontal component of
the needle is longer than <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>, we
know the needle is guranteed to cross a vertical line. That is, we know
the needle will cross with probability 1 if <span
class="math display">\[
\ell \sin(\theta) \geq d
\]</span> or <span class="math display">\[
\theta \geq \arcsin(d/\ell).
\]</span> Otherwise, we can note that the answer is the same as the
short case. Therefore, <span class="math display">\[
\begin{align*}
P &amp;= \int_{\theta=0}^{\arcsin(d/\ell)}
\int_{x=0}^{(\ell/2)\sin(\theta)} \frac{4}{d\pi} \diff x \diff\theta +
\frac2\pi\left({\frac\pi 2 - \arcsin(d/\ell)}\right) \\\ &amp;= \frac{2\ell}{d\pi} \left(1- \cos(\arcsin(d/\ell))\right) -
\frac2\pi\arcsin(d/\ell) + 1 \\\ &amp;=\frac{2\ell}{d\pi} \left(1-
\frac{\sqrt{\ell^2-d^2}}{\ell}\right) - \frac2\pi\arcsin(d /\ell) + 1.
\end{align*}
\]</span></p>
<h3 id="buffons-noodle">Buffon’s Noodle</h3>
<p>The aptly named Buffon’s Noodle problem deals with a generalization
of the needle problem – what we consider a “noodle” instead of a needle?
In technical terms, we consider a smooth (reasonably well-behaved)
continuous random curve. In this case, the probability distribution
depends on the curve, but (critically) the expected value of the number
of crossings does not. We will go through the rough proof here (a more
detailed treatment can be found in <a
href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Introduction_to_Geometric_Probability/Q1ytkNM6BtAC?hl=en">Klain
&amp; Rota</a>).</p>
<p>We first consider a piecewise linear curve (i.e. polygonal),
consisting of say <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> line segments.
In particular, we can control <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> to
make the line segments as small as we want (since if the line segments
are too long, we can break them up into consecutive smaller segments).
So for individual length small enough, each segment can only have at
most one crossing. Denote <span
class="math inline">\(X_1,\dots,X_n\)</span> as the indicator RV’s of
crossing for each segment. Then <span class="math display">\[
\mathbb E[X_1+\dots + X_n] = \mathbb E[X_1] + \dots + \mathbb E[X_n]
\tag{1}
\]</span></p>
<p>denotes the expected total number of crossings of the polygonal
curve. From the definition of indicators, we can know that <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb E[X_k] = \mathbb P ({\text{segment $k$ has
a crossing})}\)</span>. We can conclude here easily with our previous
result on the needle; but we shan’t and proceed in a different
manner.</p>
<p>We can easily observe <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb E[X_k] =
f(L_k)\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(L_k\)</span> is the
length of the linear segment. Then from (1) we can get that <span
class="math inline">\(f(L_1 + L_2) = f(L_1) + f(L_2)\)</span> i.e. <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is a linear transformation <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb \R\to\mathbb\R\)</span>. We can write
<span class="math display">\[
f(L) = c L
\]</span> with <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> a constant to be
determined. We can determine <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> with
a useful curve of our choice. In particular, we can choose a circle
<span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> with radius <span
class="math inline">\(d/2\)</span>, which will almost surely intersect
two vertical lines. Thus <span class="math display">\[
\mathbb E[S_{\text{crossings}}] = 2.
\]</span> meanwhile the length of the curve is <span
class="math inline">\(\pi d\)</span>. Thus <span class="math display">\[
f(\pi d) = c\pi d =2; \qquad c=\frac{2}{\pi d}
\]</span> and thus we can conclude <span class="math display">\[
\mathbb E[\text{crossings}] = \frac{2L}{\pi d}.
\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> is the length of the
curve. We can verify this agrees with the needle case solved above.</p>
