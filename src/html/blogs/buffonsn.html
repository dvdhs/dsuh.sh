<em> Note: This article is outdated, basic, and easy. I no longer think it really provides much of any value. However, I am opting keep
  this article archived, because 1.) It is a good test for my personal website,
  the static generation of which I program and maintain personally, and 2.)
  I do not believe in simply erasing the past. Enjoy :) </em>
