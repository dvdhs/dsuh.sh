Hi! I'm David Suh, a passionate engineer, programmer, and math enthusiast.
A close friend of mine hooked me onto programming in highschool and I haven't
stopped since.
I was born in 2001 in Austin, Texas, and spent some time there before moving
back to South Korea, where I spent much of my formative years. I returned to the
US for college, where I attended the University of Chicago from 2020-2024.
I acquired a B.A. in Mathematics and Computer Science, and also squeezed in
a M.S. in Computer Science in those years. 
<br>
<br>
I currently work in high-frequency trading as a performance engineer in
Chicago, Illinois. I don't think I'm a particularly talented 
programmer or engineer but I try my best. My hobbies are lifting and running, gaming, and programming
when I'm not tired of it from my job. 
<br>
<br>
My areas of interest include, but are not limited to: low level optimizations,
SIMD programming, parallel programming, machine learning, networks. 
My favorite IDE is vim + tmux with plugins.
